# DatabaseInWPF
________________________________________________

Small assignment to introduce adding a database into a WPF application.
Two tables an employee and assets table which you can press a button and 
it will pull from the table and input into a table. I think everything 
works correctly but I could never get the database to open on my PC through
visual studio, but the program still pulled correctly from the tables so
I guess it works.
